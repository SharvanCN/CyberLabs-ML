# CyberLabs-ML
This repository contains the 4 essential machine-learning models namely Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN and Neural networks. 
All files are in the .ipnyb format which can be opened using either Jupyter notebook or Google Colab. All models are implemented from scratch using only numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
### Linear regression:-
The model is trained on the linear_train data set with 20 features. It fits a straight line into the data. The model has an R2 score of 0.84 on the test set. The final output includes the weights and the bias term in the variables w_final, b_final
### Polynomial Regression:-
The model fits a polynomial of the 5th degree into the data set
